                    <p class="main-text">I have roughly 80 hours on my current save, and I have unlocked everything up to the space elevator tier 3. I started in the 'Northern Forest' starting location, and will expand and build factories throughout the map as I progress more. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="main-text">I am currently in the middle of setting up a train network that spans across the entire map of the game. This network will be for transporting resources, power, and myself. It will be the backbone of the world going forward, meaning every major factory built in the future will be connected to the train network in some way.</p>

                        Here are a few layouts for automating items that you will always need. It is good to get these set up a soon as you can so that the resources can start going into storage for later use.

                    <p class="main-text">    
                        Any Input and Output values are measured in items per minute, as that is what the game uses to calculate amounts of items, ratios, and belt speeds as well. If there is no clock speed listed with the placement of a building, then it should be at 100% clockspeed. Pay attention to what level converyer belts you have unlocked, and make sure that you can transport the required number of materials on them.
