                        Season 16: Breaking the Conventions Game: SE/\/SE.
                        <br>
                        Se/\/Se is a strategy, maze, horror game where you use your five senses to escape a mansion full of monsters. The senses you cherish most are ripped from you one by one and you must now survive without it. Make it through all five levels to escape. Will you navigate your way through the danger?

                        Here are a few layouts for automating items that you will always need. It is good to get these set up a soon as you can so that the resources can start going into storage for later use.

                    <p class="main-text">    
                        Any Input and Output values are measured in items per minute, as that is what the game uses to calculate amounts of items, ratios, and belt speeds as well. If there is no clock speed listed with the placement of a building, then it should be at 100% clockspeed. Pay attention to what level converyer belts you have unlocked, and make sure that you can transport the required number of materials on them.
